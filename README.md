# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Trend analysis using Kickstarter data

Project Overview
----------------
  To help Louise gain valuable insights into the past crowdfunding outcomes in order to best position her go to market fundraising strategy for her play, Fever. 
  
Analysis and Challenges
-----------------------
  This analysis was performed using Kickstarter data, specifically as it relates to the funding goal, amount actually pledged, number of backers for each campaign, as well as the ultimate outcome for each different type of fundraising campaign. Although I did not run into any issues while performing this analysis, there is always the issue, especially with large data sets, of missing information. It is important to properly scrub the data to ensure that you do not encounter any issues that may effect your conclusion once the analysis is completed. 
  
Results
-------
  During this analysis, I drilled into the data and extracted outcomes based on launch date for theatre campaigns. What you see in the data is that theatre campaigns that launched in the month of May had the highest number of successful campaigns, with the least successful starting in December. This provides valuable insight into when Lousie should start her campaign, assuming her timeline allows for it. Although success exhibits seasonality, failed and canceled campaigns do not follow this behavior. Overall, successful campaigns exhibit a slightly downward trend as the year progresses, with failed campaigns exhibiting a flat to slightly upward trend over that same period. 
  The second part of the analysis takes a look at the percentage outcomes based on the campaign goal. Although there are peaks and troughs for both successful and failed campaigns, the overall trend shows that as the goal amount increases, the liklihood of success decreases and liklihood of failure increases. Given the fact that Louise has a budget of $10,000, she has a 54% chance of meeting her campaign goal and a 46% change of failure. 
  One major limitiation of this dataset is the fact that it only contains Kickstarter data through 2017 and although it can provide some insight, it is 4 years stale and does not shine any light on more recent appetite for theater productions. Additionally, it would be helpful to know the background of each campaigns director, specifically how many plays they have put on and how many times they have successfully fundraised in the past. By having this data, you could analyze further to see if there is any correlation between success and number of plays/fundraising campaigns in the directors past.
